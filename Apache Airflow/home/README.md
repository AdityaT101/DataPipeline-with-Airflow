This Project revolves around creating the Datapipeline for the following tasks:-

1. Staging the data on Redshift.
2. Creating a Dimensional model on the staged schema.
3. Performing the Data Quality operation on the Dimensional tables.

In addition to this, I have also created some custom operators which are being reused to execute 
multiple such tasks.
